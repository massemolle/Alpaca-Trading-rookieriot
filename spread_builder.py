"""Turns a (ticker, direction) signal from the vendored screening/signals
modules into a concrete credit vertical spread: an expiration, a short
strike near the target delta, and a long strike `spread_width_dollars`
further out-of-the-money.

Bull put spread on a 'long' signal (sell a put, buy a further-OTM put —
profits if the underlying stays flat or rises). Bear call spread on a
'short' signal (sell a call, buy a further-OTM call — profits if the
underlying stays flat or falls). Both are defined-risk: max loss is fixed
at (width - credit received) the moment the spread opens, which is exactly
what risk_gate.check_new_spread checks against.

REAL API SHAPES (verified against the live account 2026-08-26, replacing an
earlier version's guessed field names — see git history for what was wrong):
- `get_option_contracts` (NOT get_option_chain) is the structural chain
  listing: response is `{"data": {"option_contracts": [...], "next_page_token": ...}}`,
  each contract a dict with STRING-typed `strike_price`/`open_interest`
  (nullable), plus `symbol`, `expiration_date`, `type` ("call"/"put").
  Param name is `underlying_symbols` (plural, comma-separated string),
  unlike get_option_chain's `underlying_symbol` (singular) — a real,
  easy-to-miss inconsistency in Alpaca's own tool schemas.
- `get_option_snapshot` response is `{"data": {"snapshots": {symbol: {...}}}}`
  — one level deeper than assumed originally — and each snapshot's quote is
  under camelCase `latestQuote: {bp, ap, bs, as, ...}` (bid/ask price/size),
  NOT `latest_quote.bid_price`/`ask_price`.
- NO GREEKS AVAILABLE on this account on any feed: `feed=opra` 403s with
  "OPRA agreement is not signed" (real-time OPRA data requires Alpaca's
  paid Algo Trader Plus subscription — confirmed via Alpaca's own forum,
  not just this account's error message), and `feed=indicative` (the free
  tier) returns a quote with no `greeks` key at all. Delta is computed
  in-process instead — see black_scholes.py's module docstring for why
  this is a reasonable proxy, not a hack.
