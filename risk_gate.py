"""Deterministic risk gate — the hard backstop the LLM decision layer cannot
override. This is what the hackathon's required one-pager's "risk gates"
section describes: every one of these checks runs in plain Python, after
the LLM has proposed a trade, not as a prompt instruction the model could
ignore or rationalize past.

Gates, in order, any one of which blocks the trade:
1. Daily loss circuit breaker — no new spreads once today's account P&L
   breaches -max_daily_loss_pct (mirrors trading_bot/config.py's own
   validated 3% breaker).
2. Max concurrent spreads — caps total open positions regardless of how
   many attractive signals show up in one cycle.
3. Per-spread max loss — a spread whose defined max loss (width - credit)
   exceeds max_loss_per_spread_pct of current equity is rejected outright,
   never resized down silently (a silently-shrunk position is a different
   trade than the one that was reasoned about).
4. DTE window — rejects anything outside [min_dte, max_dte], since the
   entire judged window is ~5 trading days and this keeps every position's
   fate resolved on a timescale the judges can actually see.

`should_force_close` is a separate, unconditional exit trigger (not part of
the entry gate above): a spread opened late in the week could otherwise
still be open, unrealized, and undemonstrated when the contest ends — this
closes it regardless of profit/loss once expiration or the contest deadline
is imminent (2026-08-26 research pass; see ONE_PAGER.md).
